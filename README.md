# What is Fresh Banana?
  Currently, what you see is not much. it's a simple 2D platformer which youmay freely look at and use as a resource. It is programmed in c# and was made in Unity.
  
#I don't understand what line ___ does.
  I am currenly working on going back and commenting the code. It will be painful, but I have for sure learned my lesson this time. Overall, don't worry, but if you have any questions feel free to post an issue.
  
#I found a bug.
  Post it in the issues.
  
#I have a suggestion.
  Also post these in the Issues.
  
#It's been ___ months since you updated this game. Is it done?
  No, most definately not. This summer (2016) I have determined that I plan on taking this game a bit farther and no longer wish to distributemy code -- for now at least. What's here will stay and will always stay and as previously mentioned, I will go bacy and polish this. As for the future of the game, I am going to be posting my progress on http://scratchabear.blogspot.com/ as soon as I get that up and running. so no. I am not in fact dead and I will be posting new projects when I have the chance. Please stay tuned for that.
